## Hi there 👋

I'm Cris, a software developer who enjoys building things that solve my own problems and help me learn something new.

Most of my projects are built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind because I love how smooth and fast that stack feels.
For data-focused work, I switch to Python, and I’m also exploring other languages to see what fits my style best.

I enjoy tinkering too, I’ve built things using Raspberry Pi, and I love learning more about Linux while experimenting.

### What I’m into right now:

- Improving my React/TypeScript skills
- Building more personal projects
- Exploring Java and PHP
- Making small tools that scratch my own itch
- Tinkering with Raspberry Pi and learning Linux

### Fun Facts:

- Currently learning Dutch
- I love building things for myself
- I run on caffeine
- **Hobbies**: gaming, anime, gym, and jumping into new project ideas
